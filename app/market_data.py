"""Read-only public market-data client for the dashboard candlestick charts.

ISOLATION / SAFETY
==================
This module is deliberately SEPARATE from `dma_client` and the signed trading
path. It talks ONLY to a public market-data host (Bybit v5, no authentication),
carries NO API key or secret, and performs NO request signing. It therefore
cannot place, cancel, or read account / funds data — it serves public OHLC
candles only. There is no write capability anywhere in this file.

Abuse / SSRF protection: the route layer requires a logged-in session, and the
symbol + interval are validated server-side BEFORE any upstream call. A symbol
is allowed only if it is on the static CHART_SYMBOLS allowlist OR is a symbol
the market scanner has actually observed in the venue's live ticker universe
(a bounded, venue-authoritative set — never an arbitrary string). The upstream
URL/host is fixed from configuration and only the (validated) symbol/interval/
limit vary — so this proxy can never be coerced into fetching an arbitrary URL
or market.
