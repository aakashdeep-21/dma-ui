"""Background sync: mirror executions & closed-PnL from the exchange into MongoDB.

Runs inside the web process (started from the FastAPI lifespan, like the
Telegram watcher): every SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS (default one minute) it brings
the `Trades` and `Closed-PnL` collections up to date, so the exchange's history
endpoints are only ever hit from here — the dashboard reads MongoDB (app/db.py). On an empty
collection it backfills SYNC_BACKFILL_DAYS of history in sequential <=7-day
windows; afterwards each run only covers the span since the newest stored
record. Fetching stays strictly cursor-free (startTime/endTime windows with
time-bisection, see app/dma_client.py) because the signer cannot survive the
gateway's percent-encoded cursors.

Crash-safety model (the invariants everything below leans on):
  * Windows are walked OLDEST -> NEWEST and each window is upserted before the
    next is fetched, so the stored data is always a contiguous prefix of the
    planned range. The resume point (watermark) is derived from the DATA
    itself — max tsMs in the collection — so it can never point past a gap:
    a crashed/aborted run simply leaves less data, never wrong state.
  * Re-running is idempotent: `_id` is the record's natural identity (execId /
    orderId:updatedTime) and writes are ReplaceOne upserts, so overlap and
    repeats are free. Each run restarts two hours before the watermark to
    absorb same-millisecond ties and late-visible records.
  * Budget exhaustion (transient) STOPS the run — continuing would advance the
    watermark past unfetched ranges and permanently hide them. Density
    truncation (permanent: a <=60s span still saturating the 100-record page)
    only WARNS and moves on — no retry can ever fix it, and stopping would
    wedge the sync on that window forever.
